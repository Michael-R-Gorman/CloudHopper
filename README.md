# CloudHopper
Cloud Hopper is a "Flappy Bird" Style game where the player gains score by hopping past clouds.
A gameover occurs when the player gets pushed to the back of the screen by the clouds or falls of the top or bottom of the screen.
There is an achievement system and stats section so you can see your progress.
The game was developed in Unity using C# for all the various game scripts.
Checkout a short demo of the game here:
